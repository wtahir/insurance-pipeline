# --- Chunking configuration ---
# All parameters are now centralised in config.py and can be overridden
# via environment variables (CHUNK_SIZE, CHUNK_OVERLAP, etc.).
# chunk_size: how many characters per chunk
# chunk_overlap: how many characters repeated between consecutive chunks
#   Why overlap? If a claim number appears at the end of chunk 3 and the
#   relevant context is at the start of chunk 4, overlap ensures both
#   chunks contain enough context to be useful independently.
# min_chunk_size: chunks smaller than this get discarded — too small to be useful
# short_doc_threshold: documents with fewer characters than this
#   get stored as a single chunk regardless of size
